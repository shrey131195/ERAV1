# Spaces App: Image Classification Explorer
## Overview
Welcome to the Image Classification Explorer Spaces App! This app allows you to interact with an image classification model trained using PyTorch Lightning, powered by Gradio, and integrated with Spaces for easy deployment. You can explore the model's predictions, visualize GradCAM images, view misclassified images, upload your own images for classification, and much more.
